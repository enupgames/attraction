    run project from scenes/SceneGame

    ManagerMain is the 'main()'

simple attraction/repulsion 
    for each run
        balls are randomly assigned which color they are attracted to and repelled by    

    movement is very simple. ie.
        if x > target_x
            x = x + 1 
        
use H to hide/show command panel

attraction distance    
    local   = only affected by nearby balls
    global  = accounts for all balls
